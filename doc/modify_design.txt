BasicBlockSplitter----
    For each tuple:
        If tuple is <label tuple> or <func tuple> 
            if current basic block has not started, add tuple and label to block's labels.
            otherwise, end current block, start a new basic block, add tuple and label to the new block's labels.
                And add normal edge between the old block and the new block.
            if the tuple is <func tuple>, mark the current block(after above processing) as <entrance block>.

        If tuple is <jump tuple>, <branch tuple> or <call tuple>
            add the tuple to current block.
            Then end current block, start a new basic block.
            if the tuple is <branch tuple> or <call tuple>
                Add normal edge between the old block and the new block.

        If tuple is <return tuple>,
            add the tuple to current block.
            Then end current block, start a new block.
            Mark the old block as <exit block>.
        
        For other tuples,
            add the tuple to current block.

    <label tuple>: LABEL
    <func tuple>: FUNC
    <jump tuple>: JMP
    <branch tuple>: BEQ, BEZ
    <call tuple>: CALL // consider this, whether we need add edge for such tuple
    <return tuple>: RET
