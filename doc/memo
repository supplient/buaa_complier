Grammar TODO:
    * Improve error detecting.

Semantics TODO:
    * Modify ADD logic, reduce temp var's use.

DAG TODO:
    * sub_var may contain @2_x and @3_x at the same time. It may be better if they are merged.
    * for tree like 
        `
        a = 1
        a = a + 1
        c = a
        `
        there is no need to create @0_a, since a's old value is only used by itself's updating.
    * maybe there is no need to assign final_value to DAGVar
    * concern about reducing "ASSIGN" 's number.

Backend TODO:
    * Support just input tuple file, then trans to MIPS.
