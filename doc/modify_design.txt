BasicBlockSplitter----
    For each tuple:
        If tuple is <label tuple> or <func tuple> 
            if current basic block has not started, add tuple and label to block's labels.
            otherwise, end current block, start a new basic block, add tuple and label to the new block's labels.
                And add normal edge between the old block and the new block.
            if the tuple is <func tuple>, mark the current block(after above processing) as <entrance block>.

        If tuple is <jump tuple>, <branch tuple> or <call tuple>
            add the tuple to current block.
            Then end current block, start a new basic block.
            if the tuple is <branch tuple> or <call tuple>
                Add normal edge between the old block and the new block.

        If tuple is <return tuple>,
            add the tuple to current block.
            Then end current block, start a new block.
            Mark the old block as <exit block>.
        
        For other tuples,
            add the tuple to current block.

    <label tuple>: LABEL
    <func tuple>: FUNC
    <jump tuple>: JMP
    <branch tuple>: BEQ, BEZ
    <call tuple>: CALL // consider this, whether we need add edge for such tuple
    <return tuple>: RET




DAG----
    Builder----
        ASSIGN
            search for left's node, if not exist, create a left's node. [this step will be omitted below.]
            search for left's assign node, if exists, continue search the assign node's assign node.
                if the assign node's var == the var to be assigned, update var_tab and do nothing.
            If reach the assign list's top, add a new assign node and update var_tab.

        NEG
            check if there is a left's father with NEG op.
            If not exist, create OpNode with NEG op, set node.left = left 
            If exists, create a ASSIGN node based on the existed NEG node. [this step will be omitted below.]
            delegate is `res`[means when search `res`, can find this Node]
            left: `left`

        RARRAY, ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, LESS, LESSOREQUAL, MORE, MOREOREQUAL, NOTEQUAL, EQUAL
            delegate is `res`
            left: `left`
            right: `right`

        WARRAY
            delegate is `res`
            left: `left`
            mid: `res`
            right: `right`

        PARAM
            delegate is `STACK` and `PARAM`
            left: `left`
            mid: `res`
            right: `right`
            spe_1: `STACK`
            spe_2: `PARAM`

        INPUT
            delegate is `STREAM` and `res`
            spe_1: `STREAM`

        OUTPUT
            delegate is `STREAM` and `PARAM`
            left: `left`[optional]
            right: `right`[optional]
            spe_1: `STREAM`
            spe_2: `PARAM`

    Old value bug----
        For tuples like:
            b = a + 1
            a = a + 2
            c = a + 3
        The origin DAG algorithm may give a wrong answer.

        Solution----
            Create a variable called like #I_0_a for a's mapping node, if a will be mapped to another node in DAG.
            #I_<index>_<var_name>

    Multiple assgin problem----
        For tuples like:
            b = a + 1;
            a = 3;
            a = 4 + 2;
            c = a;

        Solution----
            # TODO
